## ðŸš€ News

**April 6, 2024**:fire:

- We have retrained a new PowerPaint, taking inspiration from Brushnet. The [Online Demo](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/rangoliu/PowerPaint) has been updated accordingly. **We plan to release the model weights and code as open source in the next few days**.
- Tips: We preserve the cross-attention layer that was deleted by BrushNet for the task prompts input.

**December 22, 2023**:wrench:
  
- The logical error in loading ControlNet has been rectified. The `gradio_PowerPaint.py` file and [Online Demo](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/rangoliu/PowerPaint) have also been updated.

The `gradio_PowerPaint.py` file and [Online Demo](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/rangoliu/PowerPaint) have also been updated as part of this release.
